### Added

- **Breaking change** - renames `emit_trace_signals` to `signals.trace` in conductor config [#1431](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-rust/pull/1431)
- "Consistency" signals added, which aid determinism in end-to-end tests, configurable through `signals.consistency` conductor config [#1431](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-rust/pull/1431)
- Uses regex matching for `get_links` tags and type. Probably not a breaking change but be careful of subset matching (e.g. `some` will match against `some-tag` but `^some$` will not.) [#1453](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-rust/pull/1453)
- **Breaking Change** genesis function now renamed to init [#1417](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-rust/pull/1417)
