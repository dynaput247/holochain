### Added

*  Adds the `--properties`/`-p` flag to `hc package` which takes a stringifed JSON object to be inserted in the .dna.json under the properties field. This will alter the DNA hash and can therefore be used for fork DNAs from their source code. [#1720](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-rust/pull/1720)
