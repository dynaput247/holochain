- [Learn Using Test Driven Development](https://github.com/holochain/dev-camp-tests-rust)
- [Holo](https://holo.host/). (People often confuse Holo and Holochain. To make it clear they are not the same thing, Holo is actually a web hosting happ, built on Holochain, to make it easier to bridge users to Holochain via web apps without having to know anything about Holochain, or do anything with it. It is not the same thing as Holochain, the agent-centric distributed app framework with unlimited scalability, or with scalability at least proportional to the number of nodes, with the limit on that number only being constrained by physics, number of computers,).
- [Producer’s Market](https://www.producersmarket.com/). Provides a market or exchange for producers and consumers, with at least the initial focus on agriculture. See also [this blog post](https://holochaincitizen.com/2018/09/15/why-did-this-agricultural-supply-chain-start-up-choose-holochain-over-stellar-ethereum-and-hashgraph/).
- [Morpheus Network](https://morpheus.network/): automated, global, platform-agnostic supply-chain network.
- [Holosupply](http://www.holosupply.io/): digital supply chain integration platform.
- [Hypergroove](https://www.hypergroove.co.uk/): a data-driven, SaaS platform for more sustainable, inclusive, community-driven agri-food systems, with a focus on urban agriculture and p2p trade.
- [Redgrid](https://redgrid.io/): a SaaS platform for the Internet of Energy, connecting energy generation and storage devices and owners with power-consuming appliances and users. The first app built will be "Market Adaptive Demand Management, which will allow users’ high consumption devices—such as HVACs—to automatically respond to external market prices and signals in order to reduce consumption and costs. This will be applied to households, commercial buildings and multi-building sites. The application will be integrated into utility demand management programs to pay users for reducing their demand peaks, easing strain on the grid." It also aims to provide access to the 1.2b people in energy poverty. See also https://holo.host/project/redgrid/.
- [Metavents](https://www.metavents.com/): a planning platform for events and humanitarian project with event fees donated to the same humanitarian projects, using the transparency of Holochain. It uses visual planning with 2D, 3D, VR/AR and AI.
- [Bridgit](https://beta.bridgit.io/) / [Crowdfact](http://crowdfact.io/). Bridgit is a Distributed Search and Discovery protocol and a protocol for the OverWeb, a new layer of trust, ideas, interactions, and experiences that display on top of the page source. Available as a Chrome extension. Crowdfact is part of Bridgit and involves crowd-sourced fact-checking.
- [Scribe](https://github.com/iPlumb3r/Th3Sr1b3Pr0j3ct): The SCRIBE Project aims to build a distributed Conceptionary Manager which is a distributed application that allows to manage one or more Conceptionaries. There's a Github repo at https://github.com/iPlumb3r/Th3Sr1b3Pr0j3ct.
- [Prtcl (The Underscore Protocol)](http://www.uprtcl.io/): a way for people to share ideas, content creation, and conversation with each other. It is inspired by Git, which is a version control system for distributed tracking changes in software development. It allows collaborators to work together on idea contexts and to develop branches of multiple perspectives within those contexts. It also supports arranging and nesting different but related contexts into more complex idea structures. Video timestamp. See also this video [here](https://youtu.be/Y8gXQankAu8?t=435).
- [Set Match Games](https://www.setmatchgames.com/): a platform for collaborative for video game design. See also this video [here]( https://youtu.be/Y8gXQankAu8?t=481).
- [Hololution](https://hololution.io/): personal productivity apps that will then transform into collaboration apps. Video timestamp: https://youtu.be/Y8gXQankAu8?t=503.
- [Omni](https://github.com/OmniProject/omni): The Omni project establishes a global scholarly commons. Omni is a distributed scholarly network for direct scholarly communication, treated as main access point for all other Omni Project applications.
- [humm](https://humm.earth/): a beautiful p2p publishing platform. Control your content and its distribution, own your creativity and humanity. They're aiming to foster a new kind of economy around content creation (which Holochain would be suitable for with microtransfers). Video timestamp: https://youtu.be/Y8gXQankAu8?t=597.
- [Comet](https://github.com/MightyAlex200/Comet). Holochain powered distributed Reddit-like application, with differences. "Because it is built on Holochain, Comet has no censorship or moderation, and can run on the devices of the users without the help of servers. Comet also replaces the idea of "subreddits" with tags, and allows posts to be created and crossposted with more than 1 tag. Perhaps the most interesting feature of Comet, though, is its voting system. Firstly, votes can be fractional, they range from -1 to 1. Votes are also not counted as "objective". The scores of posts and comments are always calculated from the perspective of a particular agent (the user). This agent will have upvoted and downvoted other posts from other people. The score is counted depending on how the agent has voted on the other voters in the past. This helps fight spam, vote manipulation, and helps maintain community in an otherwise lawless space."
