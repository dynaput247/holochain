# Intro to TOML Config Files

WHAT TOML IS

The conductor requires a configuration file to run.

You can put your configuration file in `~/.holochain/conductor/conductor_config.toml` or run `conductor` explicitly with the `-c` to specify where to find it.

The [holochain-nodejs conductor](./testing_functions.md#configuration-alternatives) also accepts the same TOML based configuration.

```toml
