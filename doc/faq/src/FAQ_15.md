# Should I build my coin/token on Holochain?

> Since it's agent-centric instead of data-centric like traditional blockchains, Holochain isn't the best platform on which to build a token or coin.

The idea of tokens or coins is a direct representation of a system being data-centric. While theoretically it would be possible to create a token on Holochain, it would be taking a step back instead of a step forward. The more exciting possibility is creating mutual credit currencies on Holochain. These are agent-centric currencies that are designed to facilitate active exchange of value and flourishing ecosystems instead of hoarding.
