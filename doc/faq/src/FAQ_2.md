# Why do you call it "Holochain"?

> A variety of reasons: it's a composed whole of other technologies, it's structurally holographic, and it empowers holistic patterns.

## A unified cryptographic _whole_

Holochain is made from multiple cryptographic technologies composed into a new whole.

- **Hashchains:** Hashchains provide immutable data integrity and definitive time sequence from the vantage point of each node. Technically, we're using hash treesâ€”blockchains do too, but they're not called blocktrees, so we're not calling these holotrees.

- **Cryptographic signing** of chains, messages, and validation confirmations maintain authorship, provenance, and accountability. Countersigning of transactions/interactions between multiple parties provide non-repudiation and "locking" of chains.

- **DHT (Distributed Hash Table)** leverages cryptographic hashes for content addressable storage, while randomizing of interactions by hashing into neighborhoods to impede collusion, and processing validation #1 and #2 to store data on the DHT.

## *Holo*graphic storage

Every node has a resilient sample of the whole. Like cutting a hologram, if you were to cut a Holochain network in half (make it so half the nodes were isolated from the other half), you would have two whole, functioning systems, not two partial, broken systems.

This seems to be the strategy used to create resilience in natural systems. For example, where is your DNA stored? Every cell carries its own copy, with different functions expressed based on the role of that cell.

Where is the English language stored? Every speaker carries it. People have different areas of expertise, or exposure to different slang or specialized vocabularies. Nobody has a complete copy, nor is anyone's version exactly the same as anyone else, If you disappeared half of the English speakers, it would not degrade the language much.

If you keep cutting a hologram smaller and smaller eventually the image degrades enough to stop being recognizable, and depending on the resiliency rules for DHT neighborhoods, holochains would likely share a similar fate. Although, if the process of killing off the nodes was not instantaneous, the network may be able to keep reshuffling data per redundancy requirements to keep it alive.

## *Hol*archy

Holochains are composable with each other into new levels of unification. In other words, Holochains can build on decentralized capacities provided by other Holochains, making new holistic patterns possible. Like bodies build new unity on holographic storage patterns that cells use for DNA, and a society build new unity on the holographic storage patterns of language, and so on.
