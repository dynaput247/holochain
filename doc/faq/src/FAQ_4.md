# What kind of projects is Holochain good for?

Sharing collaborative data without centralized control. Imagine a completely decentralized Wikipedia, DNS without root servers, or the ability to have fast reliable queries on a fully distributed PKI, etc.

- **Social Networks, Social Media & VRM:** You want to run a social network without a company like Facebook in the middle. You want to share, post, publish, or tweet to shared space, while automatically keeping a copy of these things on your own device.

- **Supply Chains & Open Value Networks:** You want to have information that crosses the boundaries of companies, organizations, countries, which is collaboratively shared and managed, but not under the central control of any one of those organizations.

- **Cooperatives and New Commons:** You want to create something which is truly held collectively and not by any particular individual. This is especially good for digital assets.

- **P2P Platforms:** Peer-to-Peer applications where every person has similar capabilities, access, responsibilities, and value is produced collectively.

- **Collective Intelligence:** Governance, decision-making frameworks, feedback systems, ratings, currencies, annotations, or work flow systems.

- **Collaborative Applications:** Chats, Discussion Boards, Scheduling Apps, Wikis, Documentation, etc.

- **Reputational or Mutual Credit Cryptocurrencies:** Currencies where issuance can be accounted for by actions of peers (like ratings), or through double-entry accounting are well-suited for holochains. Fiat currencies where tokens are thought to exist independent of accountability by agents are more challenging to implement on holochains.
