# How is Holochain different from blockchain?

> Holochain and blockchain are built for fundamentally different use cases. Blockchain is relatively good for systems where it’s absolutely necessary to maintain global consensus. Holochain is much better than blockchain at anything that requires less than universal consensus (most things): It’s faster, more efficient, more scalable, adaptable, and extendable. 

Long before blockchains were [hash chains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_chain) and [hash trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree). These structures can be used to ensure tamper-proof data integrity as progressive versions or additions to data are made. These kinds of hashes are often used as reference points to ensure data hasn't been messed with—like making sure you're getting the program you meant to download, not some virus in its place.

Instead of trying to manage global consensus for every change to a huge blockchain ledger, every participant has [their own signed hash chain](https://medium.com/metacurrency-project/perspectives-on-blockchains-and-cryptocurrencies-7ef391605bd1#.kmous6d7z) ([countersigned for transactions](https://medium.com/metacurrency-project/beyond-blockchain-simple-scalable-cryptocurrencies-1eb7aebac6ae#.u1idviscz) involving others). After data is signed to local chains, it is shared to a [DHT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table) where every node runs the same validation rules (like blockchain nodes all run the [same validation rules](https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/features/validation). If someone breaks those rules, the DHT rejects their data—their chain has forked away from the holochain.

The initial [Bitcoin white paper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) introduced a blockchain as an architecture for decentralized production of a chain of digital currency transactions. This solved two problems (time/sequence of transactions, and randomizing who writes to the chain) with one main innovation of bundling transactions into blocks which somebody wins the prize of being able to commit to the chain if they [solve a busywork problem](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Hashcash) faster than others.

Now Bitcoin and blockchain have pervaded people's consciousness and many perceive it as a solution for all sorts of decentralized applications. However, when the problems are framed slightly differently, there are much more efficient and elegant solutions (like holochains) which don't have the [processing bottlenecks](https://www.google.com/search?q=blockchain+bottleneck) of global consensus, storage requirements of everyone having a [FULL copy](https://blockchain.info/charts/blocks-size) of all the data, or [wasting so much electricity ](https://blog.p2pfoundation.net/essay-of-the-day-bitcoin-mining-and-its-energy-footprint/2015/12/20) on busywork.
