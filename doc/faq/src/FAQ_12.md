# Can you run a cryptocurrency on Holochain?

> Theoretically, yesâ€”but for the moment, we'd discourage it.

If you don't know how to issue currencies through mutual credit, or how to account for them through double entry accounting, then you probably shouldn't build one on Holochain. If you do understand those key principles, than it is not very difficult to build a cryptocurrency for which Holochain provides ample accounting and data integrity.

However, you probably shouldn't try to do it in the way everyone is used to building cryptocurrencies on a global ledger of cryptographic tokens. [Determining the status of tokens/coins](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Double-spending) is what create the need for global consensus (about the existence/status/validity of the token or coin). However, there are [other approaches to making currencies](https://medium.com/metacurrency-project/perspectives-on-blockchains-and-cryptocurrencies-7ef391605bd1) which, for example, involve [issuance via mutual credit](https://medium.com/metacurrency-project/beyond-blockchain-simple-scalable-cryptocurrencies-1eb7aebac6ae) instead of issuance by fiat.

Unfortunately, this is a hotly contested topic by many who often don't have a deep understanding of currency design nor cryptography, so we're not going to go too deep in this FAQ. We intend to publish a white paper on this topic soon, as well as launch some currencies built this way.
