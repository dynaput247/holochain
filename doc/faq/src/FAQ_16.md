# What does “agent-centric” mean? How is this different from “data-centric?”

> Agent-centric systems view data not as an object, but as a shared experience.

Traditional blockchains are data-centric: they rely on and are built around the concept that data is a thing—an object. Holochain transitions to agent-centricism: the idea that data is shared experiences seen from many points of view. It's not a thing. It's a collection of shared, relative experiences. Einstein discovered this about the physical world a hundred years ago—Relativity. So why are modern blockchains that are supposedly "cutting edge" still falling back on this antiquated idea that data is an object, and for two agents to have different views of one piece of data is wrong?

Holochain is deeply agent-centric. Using tech that embodies this mindset enables vastly richer interactions and collaboration to happen through its technology while at the same time being thousands of times more efficient.
